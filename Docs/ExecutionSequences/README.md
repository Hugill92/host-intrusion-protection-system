# Execution Sequences

Short, operator-friendly notes that describe deterministic execution flows (install, uninstall, repair, recovery)
and where evidence/logs are written. Keep these concise and neutral.

## Keep in scope
- Sequence order ("what runs when")
- Inputs/outputs (paths, artifacts)
- Evidence locations and expected results

## Out of scope
- Local-only run notes (store under Docs/_local)
- Secrets/credentials
- Full logs/dumps
