# Sprint 3 Notes


## 2026-01-26 — Admin Panel Phase B (stability + export actions)
- Added/updated Phase B notes (status + known issues):
  - ADMIN_PANEL_PHASEB_STATUS_2026-01-26.md
  - ADMIN_PANEL_PHASEB_KNOWN_ISSUES_2026-01-26.md
- Diagnostics Bundle: can succeed but may degrade UI until restart (see known issues).
- Export Baseline + SHA256: does not reliably create new baseline folders; artifacts may exist in diagnostics bundle.
- Frozen evidence log stored under Docs\_local (local-only).
