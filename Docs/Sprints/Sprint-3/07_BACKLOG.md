# Sprint 3 Backlog

**Rule:** parking lot only. Not active sprint scope unless moved into Work Breakdown.

## Carryovers / Next
- [ ] Canonical uninstall engine + deterministic uninstall telemetry and transcripts.
- [ ] Signing Health Gate preflight (fail fast on any non-Valid dependency).
- [ ] Investigate why some scripts appear to require re-sign after install/uninstall even without intentional edits; add evidence and tighten pipeline.
- [ ] V2 FeatureSet convergence engine for Windows optional features (planning ready; implement in V2).

## Future Ideas
- [ ] FeatureSet receipts surfaced in Admin Panel health row (AuditOnly/Enforce).
- [ ] Post-reboot verification run for FeatureSet convergence (verify-only).
