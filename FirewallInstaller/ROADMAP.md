# Roadmap (high-level)

This roadmap is directional and may change as the project evolves.

## Next minor versions (v1.x)
- Hardening and reliability improvements
- Better test coverage and deterministic regression runs
- Documentation improvements (install, usage, troubleshooting)
- Optional CI automation (lint/test on push)

## Next major version (v2.0)
Target: larger changes that may be breaking, such as:
- Installer/packaging changes (e.g., MSI, signed distribution workflow)
- Schema or configuration format changes (if needed)
- Expanded console integration / UI changes
- More comprehensive policy modes and management workflows
