# CODE SKILLS (Priority 0)
- PS5.1 only unless explicitly approved
- NO PS7-only syntax: ??, .Where(), etc.
- Functions defined before first use
- Avoid backticks inside double-quoted strings when generating markdown
- ScheduledTaskAction: -Argument must be a single string
- Process launch contract: powershell.exe -NoLogo -NoProfile -NonInteractive -WindowStyle Hidden (+ -STA when needed)
- After any edit: re-sign with A33 and verify Status=Valid (AllSigned gate)
- NEVER touch Firewall/Policy (immutable)
